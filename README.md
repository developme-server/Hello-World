# Hello-World
Nicola's Notes and Amazing and often Stupid Ideas :) 
I love being busy, taking my boys out, chatting to friends, organising events, filling my day with stuff, hosting my friends at my house, using my pizza oven, strong lager and generally living in my 'happy smallish but with big aspirations for life' world.
